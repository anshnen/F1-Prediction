What this means is that the model does an ok job at discriminating between drivers who will and who won't be in the top 3 for a certain race and that there isn't a high trade off between true positive rate and false positive rate. The large difference between the training and test scores also indicates that the model is overfit even after hyper tuning meaning that there is probably a problem with the data which can be address in another iteration of this exploration.\n",

This model is also easily scalable in a production environment because evaluating if else statements takes very little computational power also meaning that it could be deployed on a small computer trackside if need be \n"

    "There are multiple features that can be good discriminators for the target feature as their distributions vary for the top 3 and not top 3 classes of the target feature and we already used them to build a decent model. This however revealed that there are some flaws in the data as we had an over fit model even after hyper tuning but this is useful information and shows that in the next iteration of this project we will have to revisit some processes and improve them to try and get a better model."

# Predicting Formula 1 Podium Finishers

In the fiercely competitive world of Formula 1 racing, every fraction of a second matters, and having a strategic advantage can be the difference between winning and losing. This project focuses on accurately predicting the top 3 drivers in any given race, helping teams to identify key competitors and refine race strategies.

## Overview

This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the podium finishers (top 3 drivers) in Formula 1 races. Using a rich dataset with race results and relevant features, we created multiple models to improve prediction accuracy. Among these, a Random Forest Classifier demonstrated the highest accuracy in predicting which drivers will finish on the podium.

## Data Summary

- **Dataset Size:** 26,080 race results.
- **Attributes:** 21 fields per race result.
  - **Numerical Fields:** 12
  - **Categorical Fields:** 9
- **Data Quality:** No missing values.

## Features and Data Preparation

We enhanced the dataset by engineering new features that significantly improve the prediction of race outcomes. The dataset was clean with no missing data points, which facilitated the development of robust models.

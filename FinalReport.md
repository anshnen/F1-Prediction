In the intensely competitive world of Formula 1, every tenth of a second can determine the outcome of a race, making it essential to have every possible advantage over rivals. One critical aspect is accurately predicting race outcomes, particularly identifying the top 3 finishers. Knowing who is likely to secure a podium position enables teams to better strategize and prepare for future races.

Using the available data, we developed several new features that enhance the accuracy of predicting race outcomes and created various models to forecast the top 3 drivers in any given race. Our analysis revealed that several machine learning models effectively predict podium finishes, with the Random Forest Classifier proving to be the most accurate.
